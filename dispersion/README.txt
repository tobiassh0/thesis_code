Plots the cold plasma dispersion (in units of 1/lambda_De) as a heatmap as a function of frequency and xi_T. These are then extracted for a given frequency
to find the influence as xiT increases. 
These are then also plotted as a normalised (k-k_A)/k_A to find the difference between the Alfven dispersion (w_A = k * v_A) and the calculated plasma dispersion at a given frequency (k = n*c).
