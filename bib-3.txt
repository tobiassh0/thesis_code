	abstract = {The electromagnetic power in the ion cyclotron frequency range radiated by a tokamak plasma with energetic ions is considered. It is found that the radiation may result from plasma fluctuations which are associated with the edge localized fast magnetoacoustic eigenmodes and strongly enhanced by interaction with the energetic ions. In this case, almost all the energy transferred from the energetic particles to the waves is emitted by the plasma and the system is marginally stable due to the presence of small wave damping. In particular, this picture is consistent with the power measurements of superthermal ion cyclotron emission in the JET preliminary tritium experiment.},

	abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

As there is high interest in the fluctuations from stronger damped oscillations, especially aperiodic ones with ωR = 0, the FDT for general oscillations in magnetized plasmas for arbitrary complex frequencies ω=ωR+ıΓ is determined. Contrary to weakly damped, the aperiodic fluctuation spectra depend on the Hermitian (instead of the anti-Hermitian) part of the elements of the Maxwell operator.

We draw the readers’ attention to the inconsistency in recent results on the Thomson scattering in inhomogeneous plasma, which leads to violation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. We show, that not only the imaginary part, but also the derivatives of the real part of the dielectric susceptibility determine the amplitude and the width of the Thomson scattering spectral lines. As a result of inhomogeneity, these properties become asymmetric with respect to inversion of the sign of the frequency. A method is proposed for measuring local gradients of the electron density with the aid of Thomson scattering.},

	abstract = {Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) is detected from all large toroidal magnetically confined fusion (MCF) plasmas. It is a form of spontaneous suprathermal radiation, whose spectral peak frequencies correspond to sequential cyclotron harmonics of energetic ion species, evaluated at the emission location. In ICE phenomenology, an important parameter is the value of the ratio of energetic ion velocity to the local Alfvén speed . Here we focus on ICE measurements from heliotron-stellarator hydrogen plasmas, heated by energetic proton neutral beam injection (NBI) in the large helical device, for which takes values both larger (super-Alfvénic) and smaller (sub-Alfvénic) than unity. The collective relaxation of the NBI proton population, together with the thermal plasma, is studied using a particle-in-cell (PIC) code. This evolves the Maxwell–Lorentz system of equations for hundreds of millions of kinetic gyro-orbit-resolved ions and fluid electrons, self-consistently with the electric and magnetic fields. For LHD-relevant parameter sets, the spatiotemporal Fourier transforms of the fields yield, in the nonlinear saturated regime, good computational proxies for the observed ICE spectra in both the super-Alfvénic and sub-Alfvénic regimes for NBI protons. At early times in the PIC treatment, the computed growth rates correspond to analytical linear growth rates of the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI), which was previously identified to underlie ICE from tokamak plasmas. The spatially localised PIC treatment does not include toroidal magnetic field geometry, nor background gradients in plasma parameters. Its success in simulating ICE spectra from both tokamak and, here, heliotron-stellarator plasmas suggests that the plasma parameters and ion energetic distribution at the emission location largely determine the ICE phenomenology. This is important for the future exploitation of ICE as a diagnostic for energetic ion populations in MCF plasmas. The capability to span the super-Alfvénic and sub-Alfvénic energetic ion regimes is a generic challenge in interpreting MCF plasma physics, and it is encouraging that this first principles computational treatment of ICE has now achieved this.},

The fusion reactions and external sources must support both the pressure and the current equilibrium without inductive current drive, leading to demands on stability, confinement, current drive, and plasma-wall interactions that exceed those for pulsed tokamaks. These conditions have been met individually, and significant progress has been made in the past decade to realize scenarios where the required conditions are obtained simultaneously. Tokamaks are operated routinely without disruptions near pressure limits, as needed for steady-state operation. Fully noninductive sustainment with more than half of the current from intrinsic currents has been obtained for a resistive time with normalized pressure and confinement approaching those needed for steady-state conditions. One remaining challenge is handling the heat and particle fluxes expected in a steady-state tokamak without compromising the core plasma performance.},

	abstract = {This article is a tutorial review of the interaction between energetic particles and Alfvén eigenmodes (AEs) which is one of the important research issues for fusion burning plasmas. The destabilization mechanism of AEs is a kind of inverse Landau damping through the resonant interaction with energetic particles. The important properties of the AE instability, such as resonance condition, conserved variable during the interaction, and particle trapping by the AE, are explained. The time evolution of AEs is classified into various types, steady state, frequency splitting, frequency chirping, and recurrent bursts. Berk and Breizman presented both a one-dimensional weakly nonlinear theory for marginal stability and a reduced simulation model that qualitatively explain the various types of time evolution. Berk–Breizman’s theory and reduced simulation model are introduced, and their limitations and the future works are discussed in this article. In addition, energetic particle transport by AEs is illustrated with surface-of-section plots. The particle trapping by the AE creates phase space islands and leads to the local flattening of the energetic particle spatial profile. The resonance overlap of multiple AEs and the overlap of higher-order resonances of a single AE lead to the emergence of stochasticity in phase space and the global transport of energetic particles.},

	abstract = {Alfv´en eigenmodes (AEs) driven by energetic electrons were investigated via hybrid simulations of an MHD fluid interacting with energetic electrons. The investigation focused on AEs with the toroidal number n = 4. Both energetic electrons with centrally peaked beta profile and off-axis peaked profile are considered. For the centrally peaked energetic electron beta profile case, a toroidal Alfv´en eigenmode (TAE) propagating in the electron diamagnetic drift direction is found. The mode is mainly driven by deeply trapped energetic electrons. It is also found that a few passing energetic electrons spatially localized around rational surfaces can resonate with the mode. For the off-axis peaked energetic electron beta profile case, an AE propagating in the ion diamagnetic drift direction is found when a q−profile with weak magnetic shear is adopted. The destabilized mode is an elliptical-Alfv´en-eigenmode-type (EAE-type) mode which has a spatial profile peaking at the rational surface and a frequency close to the second Alfv´en frequency gap. It is found that passing energetic electrons and barely trapped energetic electrons are responsible for this EAE-type mode destabilization. The saturation levels are compared for a TAE with the same linear growth rate among energetic electron driven mode and energetic ion driven mode with isotropic and anisotropic velocity space distributions. The saturation level of TAE driven by trapped energetic electrons is comparable to that driven by energetic electrons with isotropic velocity space distribution where the contribution of trapped particles is dominant. It is found that the trapped energetic ion driven TAE has a larger saturation level than the passing energetic ion driven TAE, which indicates the difference in particle trapping by the TAE between trapped and passing energetic ions.},

	abstract = {It has been known that the width of the trapped particles, i.e. bananas, is reduced or squeezed in a magnetic well in tokamaks. The magnetic squeezing factor SB depends on the energy and pitch angle of the particles. When ρp/a {\textasciitilde} 1, SB becomes appreciably larger than unity; it can be of the order of 2 for a parabolic well with B-1 d2B/dr2 {\textasciitilde} 2a-2. Here, ρp is the poloidal gyro-radius, B is the magnetic field strength, r is the local minor radius, and a is the minor radius. However, the real orbit width measured in terms of the poloidal magnetic flux is still less than a because of the magnetic squeezing; for SB = 2, it is a 30\% reduction. The transport consequences of the squeezed bananas in a magnetic well are calculated by solving the drift kinetic equation utilizing the constants of motion in the large aspect ratio limit. Consequently, neoclassical ion heat conductivity χh in the reactor relevant collisionality regime (i.e. banana regime) is reduced by a factor of \$\{S\}\_\{B\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}\$; for SB = 2, it is almost a factor of three reduction for the same temperature. The ion temperature scaling of χh improves from the conventional, and weakly favorable \$\{\{T\}\_\{i\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\$ scaling to the strongly favorable \$\{\{T\}\_\{i\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ scaling for high temperature fusion grade tokamak plasmas; the scaling however does not take the temperature dependence of the magnetic well itself into account. Here, Ti is the ion temperature. In addition, it is shown that plasma turbulence is suppressed in a magnetic well using the reduced decorrelation time argument and anomalous plasma confinement is improved. The combined improvements result in a favorable temperature scaling in the ion energy confinement time, and make burning aneutronic fuels feasible. The implications on a tokamak with a magnetic well as a fusion reactor are discussed.},

	abstract = {During edge localised mode (ELM) crashes in KSTAR deuterium plasmas, bursts of spectrally structured ion cyclotron emission (ICE) are detected. Usually the ICE spectrum chirps downwards during an ELM crash, on sub-microsecond timescales. For KSTAR ICE where the separation of spectral peak frequencies is close to the proton cyclotron frequency at the outer plasma edge, we show that the driving population of energetic ions is likely to be a subset of the 3 MeV fusion protons, born centrally on deeply passing orbits which drift from the core to the edge plasma. We report first principles modelling of this scenario using a particle-in-cell code, which evolves the full orbit dynamics of large numbers of energetic protons, thermal deuterons, and electrons self-consistently with the electric and magnetic fields. The Fourier transform of the excited fields in the nonlinear saturated regime of the simulations is the theoretical counterpart to the measured ICE spectra. Multiple simulation runs for different, adjacent, values of the plasma density under KSTAR edge conditions enable us to infer the theoretical dependence of ICE spectral structure on the local electron number density. By matching this density dependence to the observed time-dependence of chirping ICE spectra in KSTAR, we obtain sub-microsecond time resolution of the evolving local electron number density during the ELM crash.},

The dispersion relation for the ordinary mode (O-mode) in a relativistic electron plasma is investigated by employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann-Jüttner distribution function. As the integration in the relativistic dispersion relation cannot be done analytically so an approximated value is obtained using the trapezoidal rule. Various modes of propagation for the ordinary waves are observed for each harmonic number n due to the relativistic effects defined by the value . We also observe that the high-temperature relativistic plasma environment is more transparent for the O-mode as compared to weakly relativistic and non-relativistic plasma environments. Moreover, the cutoff points are shifted to lower values in the relativistic limit.},

	title = {Ion cyclotron emission from energetic ion populations in fusion plasmas},
	url = {http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/134556/},
	abstract = {In this thesis I present particle in cell (PIC) simulations of ion cyclotron emission (ICE). ICE comprises suprathermal radiation in the ion cyclotron frequency range, whose spectrum peaks at successive local cyclotron harmonics of the emitting energetic ion population. ICE has previously been observed in all large toroidal MCF plasmas [Dendy and McClements, 2015; McClements et al., 2015]. ICE is caused by a collective instability, which in its linear phase corresponds to the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI). The passive, non-invasive character of ICE measurements, suggest ICE is an attractive way forward for future energetic ion measurements in ITER. In the simulations in this thesis we use the EPOCH particle-in-cell code to solve the self-consistent Maxwell-Lorentz system of equations for fully kinetic electrons and thermal background ions, together with the minority energetic ion distribution that drives the primary ICE. We first perform a detailed quantitative comparison between fusion born proton driven chirping ICE observed during KSTAR ELM crashes and fully nonlinear direct numerical simulations of the MCI. We find good quantitative agreement between the simulated and observed spectra, to the extent that the simulations can be used to infer fast (-{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}mus) time scale dynamics of the local electron number density in the emitting region. We then extend this study to determine the origin of a faint, time delayed proton chirping feature observed in one of the KSTAR plasma pulses. We do this using bicoherence analysis of both experimental and simulation data. We then run MCI PIC simulations of the pre ELM crash \${\textbackslash}backslash\$steady state" ICE observed on KSTAR, which is believed to be driven by neutral beam injected (NBI) deuterons. PIC simulations of MCI excited ICE in JET and ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) plasmas are then discussed, and we show that AUG observations of the fundamental ICE harmonic can only be explained in terms of the MCI if nonlinear wave-wave interactions between higher harmonics are taken into account. Motivated by recent observations of ICE in the core region of several tokamaks, including AUG and DIIID, we then compare MCI simulations using two types of energetic ion distribution function, a spherical shell of varying thickness, and a ring beam of varying width. It is found that both distribution functions lead to MCI excited waves, and their nonlinear properties are discussed.},

	title = {Hybrid simulations of flow bursts in magnetically confined plasmas},

	abstract = {Strongly localised concentrations or depressions of plasma density and magnetic field strength (\${\textbackslash}backslash\$blobs") are ubiquitous in the edge region of tokamak fusion experiments. They contribute significantly to heating and transport in that region, and therefore to overall energy confinement. The existing fusion plasma literature in this area focuses primarily on blobs sufficiently large that a uid description is appropriate. However, the blob population may include some - not necessarily easily detectable - whose characteristic lengthscales are on the order of the ion gyro-scales. This implies that a description at the uid level is unlikely to capture the full dynamics. In this Thesis, therefore, we report hybrid (particle ions, uid electrons) particle-in-cell simulations of ion gyro-scale blobs, which enable us to examine the effects of finite Larmor radius on their dynamics, evolution, and their ability to heat the near-edge plasma. We find that ion gyro-scale blobs are advected with the background flow, and develop a twin-celled vortex structure. Asymmetry then arises from finite ion Larmor radius kinetics, manifesting in the size of the internal vortices, the shape of tails forming from blob ejecta, and the growth of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Small scale blobs are also found to increase ion energies more than larger blobs as a result of ion pick-up at the upstream blob-background boundary, which may result in a significant increase in plasma energy caused by a blob population that is not yet directly observable. Finally, we examine the creation of ion gyro-scale blobs using hybrid simulations of kinetic interchange and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and present statistics of the sizes of blobs created by these instabilities, and power-laws for the resulting particle displacements.},

	url = {http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/133789/},
	abstract = {Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) has been reported from most magnetic confinement fusion devices (MCF), both large tokamaks and stellarators. The ICE phenomenology is rich as it results from fusion products and from neutral beam injection (NBI) energetic ions. These can drive ICE on confined trajectories or during MHD instabilities as they are expelled from the plasma. In either scenario, an inversion in velocity space perpendicular to the local magnetic field is thought to take place. In particular ICE was observed during DT experiments in both JET and TFTR, driven by the 3.5MeV a particle. Self-consistent hybrid [19] and full [20] particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI) [21] captured ICE features related to JET ICE. The linear scaling of the ICE intensity with the \_ particle density, used as a proxy for the measured neutron flux, was reported in Ref. [22]. Ion cyclotron emission has been proposed as a non invasive diagnostic in ITER [23]. In this thesis, we study ICE detected in the Large Helical Device (LHD) heliotron stellarator with hybrid PIC simulations. Unlike full PIC, hybrid PIC treats the electron as a neutralising fluid while the ion species are still fully kinetic. We focus on NBI-driven ICE in hydrogen plasmas and explore the sub- and super-Alfvenic regime where NBI proton speeds vNBI are either lower or higher than the Alfven speed which is determined at the emission location. Our simulations show that relaxation of these protons drive the MCI, at perpendicular and oblique propagation angles, and spectral peaks at proton cyclotron harmonics are obtained. Deuterium was introduced for the first time during the 2017 LHD campaign [24] and brought ICE measurements with it. The spectral features of NBI-driven ICE are reported to qualitatively and quantitatively vary across LHD plasma discharges. We interpret the observations to be the result of the different edge plasma density which controls the ratio vNBI=VA and affects the ICE power spectra as suggested by hybrid PIC simulations. Doppler-shifted ICE is detected during MHD instabilities [25]. Fusion-born protons could be driving the ICE and account for the large Doppler shifts as explored via hybrid simulations. We perform cepstra analysis on the measured spectra to identify which cyclotron harmonics are present. The hybrid kinetic dispersion relation with inertial electrons is derived, generalazing the massless case [26]. Solutions are obtained in the case of background Maxwellians and energetic ring beams and compared against the full- and neutralkinetic dispersion relations.},

	abstract = {The magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI) probably underlies observations of ion cyclotron emission (ICE) from energetic ion populations in tokamak plasmas, including fusion-born alpha-particles in JET and TFTR [Dendy et al., Nuclear Fusion 35, 1733 (1995)]. ICE is a potential diagnostic for lost alpha-particles in ITER; furthermore, the MCI is representative of a class of collective instabilities, which may result in the partial channelling of the free energy of energetic ions into radiation, and away from collisional heating of the plasma. Deep understanding of the MCI is thus of substantial practical interest for fusion, and the hybrid approximation for the plasma, where ions are treated as particles and electrons as a neutralising massless fluid, offers an attractive way forward. The hybrid simulations presented here access MCI physics that arises on timescales longer than can be addressed by fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations and by analytical linear theory, which the present simulations largely corroborate. Our results go further than previous studies by entering into the nonlinear stage of the MCI, which shows novel features. These include stronger drive at low cyclotron harmonics, the re-energisation of the alpha-particle population, self-modulation of the phase shift between the electrostatic and electromagnetic components, and coupling between low and high frequency modes of the excited electromagnetic field.},

	abstract = {Bursts of ion cyclotron emission ({ICE}), with spectral peaks corresponding to the hydrogen cyclotron harmonic frequencies in the plasma core are detected from helium plasmas heated by sub-Alfvénic beam-injected hydrogen ions in the {ASDEX} Upgrade tokamak. Based on the fast ion distribution function obtained from {TRANSP} / {NUBEAM} code, together with a linear analytical theory of the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability ({MCI}), the growth rates of {MCI} could be calculated. In our theoretical and experimental studies, we found that the excitation mechanism of core {ICE} driven by sub-Alfvénic beam ions in {ASDEX} Upgrade is {MCI} as the time evolution of {MCI} growth rates is broadly consistent with measured {ICE} amplitudes. The {MCI} growth rate is very sensitive to the energy of beam-injected ions and is suppressed by the slowing down of the dominant beam-injected ion velocity. The influence of the Dopplershift on {ICE} frequency has been observed in our experiments based on the different parallel velocity of fast ions.},

Its current and magnetic field are aligned and the structure is in a force-free state. We examine how a background magnetic field B 0 , which is parallel to the simulation direction, affects the waves in the pair plasma. A weak B 0 cannot inhibit the growth of the aperiodically growing instability but it prevents it from reaching the force-free stable state. The mode collapses and seeds a pair Alfvén waves. An intermediate B 0 couples the thermal anisotropy to the pair Alfvén mode and propagating magnetowaves grow. The phase speed of the pair of Alfvén waves is increased by the thermal anisotropy. Its growth is suppressed when B 0 is set to the value that stabilizes the mirror mode.},

	abstract = {In the course of the Preliminary Tritium Experiment in JET, where combined deuterium and tritium neutral beam injection generated a DT fusion power of 1.7 MW, ion cyclotron emission (ICE) was measured in the frequency range v ⩽ 180 MHz. The ICE spectra contain superthermal, narrow, equally spaced emission lines, which correspond to successive cyclotron harmonics of deuterons or alpha particles at the outer midplane, close to tile last closed flux surface at major radius R approximately 4.0 m. Above about 100 MHz the lines merge into a relatively intense continuum. The ICE signal fluctuates rapidly in time, and is extinguished whenever a large amplitude edge localized mode (ELM) occurs. In pure deuterium and mixed DT discharges ICE spectra are similar in form, but on changing from pure D to mixed D+T neutral beam injection at constant power, the intensity of the ICE rises in proportion to the increased neutron flux: this indicates that fusion alpha particles-and not beam ions-provide the free energy to generate ICE. The JET ICE database, which now extends over a range of six decades in signal intensity, shows that the time averaged ICE power increases almost linearly with total neutron flux. The rise and fall of the neutron flux during a single discharge is closely followed by that of the ICE signal, which is delayed by a time of the order of the fusion product slowing down time. This feature is well modelled by a TRANSP code simulation of the density of deeply trapped fusion products reaching the plasma edge. Calculations reveal a class of fusion products, born in the core, which make orbital excursions of sufficient size to reach the outer midplane edge. There, the velocity distribution has a ring structure, which is found to be linearly unstable to relaxation to obliquely propagating waves on the fast Alfven-ion Bernstein branch at all ion cyclotron harmonics. The paper shows how ICE provides a unique diagnostic for fusion alpha particles},

Our reactor consists of the following: (1) A background plasma of boron11 and hydrogen ions, plus electrons, is generated and kept for a certain time, with densities of the order of a mg/cm3 and temperatures of tens of eV. Both the radiation level and the plasma thermal pressure are thus very low. (2) A plasma channel is induced in a solid target by irradiation with a high power laser that creates a very intense shock wave. This mechanism conveys the acceleration of protons in the laser direction. The mechanisms must be tuned for the protons to reach a kinetic energy of 300–1200 keV where the pB11 fusion cross section is significantly large (note that this value is not a temperature). (3) Those ultra-fast protons enter the background plasma and collide with boron11 to produce three alphas. Fusion born alphas collide with protons of the plasma and accelerate them causing a chain reaction. (4) A combination of an induction current and a magnetic bottle keeps the chain reaction process going on, for a pulse long enough to get a high energy gain. (5) Materials for the background plasma and the laser target must be replaced for starting a new chain reaction cycle.},

	abstract = {A proton beam with a velocity of the order of 109 cm/s is generated to interact with a charge neutral hydrogen-boron medium such as H3B. The created charged particles are confined by magnetic fields. This concept was the basis for a novel non-thermal fusion reactor, published recently in Laser and Particle Beams [1]. The fusion is initiated by protons followed by a process of chain reactions in a neutral medium density of the order of 1019 cm−3, heated by the pB11 fusion created alphas up to a temperature of about one electron volt. In this system, the radiation losses by bremsstrahlung are negligible and the plasma thermal pressure is low. The ionization of the gaseous medium is caused by the alpha elastic nuclear collisions with the hydrogen atoms and their thermal heating and it is {\textless} 10−4. An external electric field is applied to avoid the energy losses of the protons particles by friction, due to their interaction with the electrons of the medium, to keep the proton-boron fusion at the maximum cross section of about 600 keV at the center of mass frame of reference. The alphas created in the pB11 fusion undergo nuclear elastic collisions with the hydrogen protons of the medium and causing a pB11 chain reaction. In this paper the equation of motion of these proton and alphas are solved numerically for the one-dimensional (1D) case, and their possible solutions are analyzed and discussed. Specifically, it is shown how the electric field can mitigate the stopping power for the proton11-proton nuclear fusion. Our results show that starting from a bunch of 1013 protons in our volume, an alpha number of particles of 6 × 1016 was accepted after a 5 ms cycle of applying our specially designed electric field. Consequently, the medium temperature was raised to 1.3 eV. The aim of this paper is to present a new concept by addressing only the main physical processes and not to present a complete engineering design. The configuration for mitigating the stopping power and the numerical solution in this paper is novel and promises few applications with a viable proton-boron11 fusion reactions.},

	abstract = {The Conceptual Design Activities of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) were carried out jointly by the European Community, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States of America, under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The European Community provided the site for joint work sessions at the Max-Planck-Institut fur Plasmaphysik in Garching, Germany. The Conceptual Design Activities began in the spring of 1988 and ended in December 1990. The objectives of the activities were to develop the design of ITER, to perform a safety and environmental analysis, to define the site requirements as well as the future research and development needs, to estimate the cost and manpower, and to prepare a schedule for detailed engineering design, construction and operation. On the basis of the investigation and analysis performed, a concept of ITER was developed which incorporated maximum flexibility of the performance of the device and allowed a variety of operating scenarios to be adopted. The heart of the machine is a tokamak having a plasma major radius of 6 m, a plasma minor radius of 2.15 m, a nominal plasma current of 22 MA and a nominal fusion power of 1 GW. The conceptual design can meet the technical objectives of the ITER programme. Because of the success of the Conceptual Design Activities, the Parties are now considering the implementation of the next phase, called the Engineering Design Activities.},

	abstract = {In this paper, experimental observations of spontaneously excited waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) on JT-60U are described. The ﬂuctuations in ICRF are driven by the presence of non-thermal ion distribution in magnetically conﬁned plasmas. Two types of magnetic ﬂuctuations are detected: one is due to high-energy D ions from neutral beam (NB) injections and the other is due to fusion products (FPs) of 3He and T ions. These ﬂuctuations have been reported as ion cyclotron emissions (ICEs) in the burning plasma experiments on large tokamaks. This paper describes the ﬁrst measurement of the spatial structures of the excited modes in the poloidal and toroidal directions. It is conﬁrmed by using ICRF antennas as pickup loops that all modes excited spontaneously have magnetic components. The modes due to D ions have zero or a small toroidal wave number kz. On the other hand, the measurement of ﬁnite kz in the modes due to FP ions supports the excitation of the Alfve´n waves, which is the possible origin of FP-ICEs. It is also observed that the excited modes due to FP ions (3He and T ions) have different characteristics: driven by different NBs and having different parameter dependences. ICE due to T ions has no harmonics and the value of ω/ ci is smaller than that due to 3He. Both beam-driven ICEs and FP-ICEs are clearly observed and their spatial structures are obtained on JT-60U.},

Energy spectrum of D–D neutrons was the focus of the studies in pure deuterium plasmas. A significant broadening of the energy spectrum of neutrons born in D–D fast fusion was observed, and dependence of the maximum D and D–D neutron energies on plasma density was established. Diagnostics of charged products of aneutronic D–3He fusion reactions, 3.7 MeV alpha-particles similar to those in D–T fusion, and 14.6 MeV protons, were the focus of the studies in D–3He plasmas. Measurements of 16.4 MeV gamma-rays born in the weak secondary branch of D(3He, γ)5Li reaction were used for assessing D–3He fusion power. For achieving high yield of D–D and D–3He reactions at relatively low levels of input heating power, an acceleration of D beam up to the MeV energy range was used employing 3rd harmonic ( f = 3fCD) ICRH technique. These results were compared to the techniques of D beam injection into D–3He mixture, and 3He-minority ICRH in D plasmas.},

	abstract = {Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) are periodic disturbances of the plasma periphery occurring in tokamaks with an H-mode edge transport barrier. As a result, a fraction of the plasma energy present in the confined hot edge plasma is transferred to the open field lines in the divertor region, ultimately appearing at the divertor target plates. These events can result in high transient heat loads being deposited on the divertor target plates in large tokamaks, potentially causing damage in devices such as ITER. Consequently it is important to find means to mitigate their effects, either avoiding them or, at least, controlling them. This in turn means it is essential to understand the physics causing ELMs so that appropriate steps can be taken. It is generally agreed that ELMs originate as MHD instability caused by the steep plasma pressure gradients or edge plasma current present in H-mode, the so-called ‘peeling-ballooning’ model. Normally this is considered to be an ideal MHD instability but resistivity may be involved. Much less clear is the non-linear evolution of these instabilities and the mechanisms by which the confined edge plasma is transferred to the divertor plasma. There is evidence for the non-linear development of ‘filamentary’ structures predicted by theory, but the reconnection processes by which these are detached from the plasma core remain uncertain. In this paper the experimental and theoretical evidence for the peeling-ballooning model is presented, drawing data from a number of tokamaks, e.g. JET, DIII-D, ASDEXUpgrade, MAST etc. Some theoretical models for the non-linear evolution of ELMs are discussed; as well as ones related to the ‘peeling-ballooning’ model, other candidate models for the ELM cycle are mentioned. The consequential heat loads on divertor target plates are discussed. Based on our current understanding of the physics of ELMs, means to avoid them, or mitigate their consequences, are described, e.g. the use of plasma shaping or introducing resonant magnetic perturbation coils to reduce plasma gradients at the plasma edge.},

	abstract = {Access conditions for full suppression of edge localised modes (ELMs) by magnetic perturbations (MP) in low density high confinement mode (H-mode) plasmas are studied in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. The main empirical requirements for full ELM suppression in our experiments are: 1. The poloidal spectrum of the MP must be aligned for best plasma response from weakly stable kinkmodes, which amplify the perturbation, 2. The plasma edge density must be below a critical value, 3.3 × 1019 m−3. The edge collisionality is in the range νi∗ = 0.15−0.42 (ions) and νe∗ = 0.15−0.25 (electrons). However, our data does not show that the edge collisionality is the critical parameter that governs access to ELM suppression. 3. The pedestal pressure must be kept sufficiently low to avoid destabilisation of small ELMs. This requirement implies a systematic reduction of pedestal pressure of typically 30\% compared to unmitigated ELMy H-mode in otherwise similar plasmas. 4. The edge safety factor q95 lies within a certain window. Within the range probed so far, q95 = 3.5−4.2, one such window, q95 = 3.57−3.95 has been identified. Within the range of plasma rotation encountered so far, no apparent threshold of plasma rotation for ELM suppression is found. This includes cases with large cross field electron flow in the entire pedestal region.},

	abstract = {The detection of fast particle-driven waves in the ion cyclotron frequency range (ion cyclotron emission or ICE) could provide a passive, non-invasive diagnostic of confined and escaping fast particles (fusion α-particles and beam ions) in ITER, and would be compatible with the high radiation environment of deuterium–tritium plasmas in that device. Recent experimental results from ASDEX Upgrade and DIII-D demonstrate the efficacy of ICE as a diagnostic of different fast ion species and of fast ion losses, while recent particle-in-cell (PIC) and hybrid simulations provide a more exact comparison with measured ICE spectra and open the prospect of exploiting ICE more fully as a fast ion diagnostic in future experiments. In particular the PIC/hybrid approach should soon make it possible to simulate the nonlinear physics of ICE in full toroidal geometry. Emission has been observed previously at a wide range of poloidal angles, so there is flexibility in the location of ICE detectors. Such a detector could be implemented in ITER by installing a small toroidally orientated loop near the plasma edge or by adding a detection capability to the ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antennae. In the latter case, the antenna could be used simultaneously to heat the plasma and detect ICE, provided that frequencies close to those of the ICRH source are strongly attenuated in the detection system using a suitable filter. Wavenumber information, providing additional constraints on the fast ion distribution exciting the emission, could be obtained by measuring ICE using a toroidally distributed array of detectors or different straps of the ICRH antenna.},

The ab initio full electromagnetic relativistic PIC codes provide the most reliable description of plasmas. Their properties are considered in detail.

The smallest scale is the laser or plasma wavelength (from one to hundred microns) and the largest scale is the acceleration distance (from a few centimeters to meters or even kilometers). The Lorentz-boost technique allows to reduce the scale disparity at the costs of complicating the simulations and causing unphysical numerical instabilities in the code. Another possibility is to use the quasi-static approxi- mation where the disparate scales are separated analytically.},

	abstract = {Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) driven by perpendicular neutral beam-injected (NBI) deuterons, together with the distinctive ICE driven by tangential NBI, have been observed from heliotron–stellarator plasmas in the large helical device (LHD). Radio frequency radiation in the lower hybrid range has also been observed Saito K. et al (2018 Plasma Fusion Res. 13 3402043), with frequency dependent on plasma density. Here we focus on recent measurements of ICE from deuterium plasmas in LHD, which show substantial variation in spectral character, between otherwise similar plasmas that have different local density in the emitting region. We analyse this variation by means of first principles simulations, carried out using a particle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic approach. We show, first, that this ICE is driven by perpendicular NBI deuterons, freshly ionised near their injection point in the outer midplane edge of LHD. We find that these NBI deuterons undergo collective sub-Alfv´enic relaxation, which we follow deep into the nonlinear phase of the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI). The frequency and wavenumber dependence of the saturated amplitudes of the excited fields determine our simulated ICE spectra, and these spectra are obtained for different local densities corresponding to the different LHD ICE-emitting plasmas. The variation with density of the spectral character of the simulated ICE corresponds well with that of the observed ICE from LHD. These results from heliotron–stellarator plasmas complement recent studies of density-dependent ICE from tokamak plasmas in KSTAR Thatipamula S.G. et al (2016 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 58 065003); Chapman B. et al (2017 Nuclear Fusion 57 124004), where the spectra vary on sub-microsecond timescales after an ELM crash. Taken together, these results confirm the strongly spatially localised character of ICE physics, and reinforce the potential of ICE as a diagnostic of energetic ion populations and of the ambient plasma.},

In this paper, a proposal is made to induce these reactions by a heat-detonation wave that expands across a compressed target. The front of the wave has a double-layer structure, with a first front driven by electron heat conduction and a second front heated by α-particle energy deposition. Both fronts create a hot plasma where the stopping power is dominated by ions. The wave is originated by an ignitor triggered by an ultraintense lightning beam. This beam can be made of photons (laser), plasma (ramjets), or ions (proton beams, borane clusters). Proton beam shots of 10

	abstract = {Abstract
            Meteorological and geophysical phenomena involve multiple-scale processes. Here the spatiotemporal wavelet transform (STWT) is applied to detect significant, nonstationary, wave propagation signals from a time–space domain. One of the major advantages of the STWT is the capability to localize the wave properties in both space and time, which facilitates the study of interactions among multiple-scale disturbances by providing relevant information about energy concentration at a given time and space. The global wavelet spectrum (scalogram) of the STWT, which gives an integrated view of the spectrum as wavenumber and frequency, provides a lucid picture of the spectral power distribution that is consistent with the result obtained from the Fourier-based space–time power spectrum. The STWT has also the capability of reconstruction and thus can be used as a spatiotemporal wave filter.
            The STWT analysis is applied to analyze the multiscale structure of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) studied by Nakazawa. All types of convectively coupled equatorial waves were identified. The analysis results reveal the structural differences between the MJO and Kelvin waves and their different relationships with the embedded westward propagating inertio-gravity (WIG) waves: for the Kelvin wave the enhanced activity of the WIG waves coincides with the most active convective area, whereas for the MJO the enhanced WIG waves occur to the east of the MJO convective center. In addition, the WIG waves in the MJO have shorter wavelengths and periods, but those in the Kelvin waves have longer wavelengths and periods. This difference may hold a key to understanding the propagation speed difference between the MJO and Kelvin waves. The possible “upscale feedback” of the WIG waves on the MJO and Kelvin waves is also discussed.},

	abstract = {During bursty {MHD} events, transient ion cyclotron emission ({ICE}) is observed from deuterium plasmas in the large helical device ({LHD}) heliotron-stellarator. Unusually, the frequencies of the successive {ICE} spectral peaks are not close to integer multiples of the local cyclotron frequency of an energetic ion population in the likely emitting region. We show that this {ICE} is probably driven by a subset of the fusion-born protons near their birth energy {MeV}. This subset has a kinetic energy component parallel to the magnetic field, , significantly greater than its perpendicular energy , for which , the Alfvén speed. First principles computations of the collective relaxation of this proton population, within a majority thermal deuterium plasma, are carried out using a particle-in-cell approach. This captures the full gyro-orbit kinetics of all ions which, together with an electron fluid, evolve self-consistently with the electric and magnetic fields under the Maxwell–Lorentz equations. The simulated {ICE} spectra are derived from the Fourier transform of the fields which are excited. We find substantial frequency shifts in the peaks of the simulated {ICE} spectra, which correspond closely to the measured {ICE} spectra following the resonance condition for nth proton harmonic. This suggests that the transient {ICE} in {LHD} is generated by the identified subset of the fusion-born protons, relaxing under the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability. So far as is known, this is the first report of a collective radiation signal from fusion-born ions in anon-tokamak magnetically confined plasma. Disambiguation between two or more energetic ion species that could potentially generate complex observed {ICE} spectra is an increasing challenge, and the results and methodology developed here will assist this. Our approach is also expected to be relevant to {ICE} driven by ion beams with lower parallel velocities, for example in cylindrical plasma experiments.},

            The two-plasmon-decay instability (TPD) in the large-incidence-angle regime is studied via fluid and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. It is found that the TPD threshold in this regime within a narrow incidence angle range close to \$60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ can be orders of magnitude lower than the normal-incidence threshold. A threshold formula is proposed for this regime and is verified by fluid and PIC simulations. PIC simulations show significant laser absorption and energetic electron generation once TPD is excited. The incident angle and the laser spot size have a significant influence on the TPD in the large-incidence-angle regime. The low threshold and significant hot electron generation in this regime pose potential unexpected preheating risks to inertial confinement fusion.},

	abstract = {This work describes a novel optical heterodyne detection scheme that significantly extends the frequency response of the phase contrast imaging method to detect electron density fluctuations in tens of megahertz frequency range. The system employs a variable frequency electro-optic modulator to allow operation at any frequency in the range 10–40 MHz without the need to realign the system. The frequency coverage of the system makes it suitable to measure the radial structure of the electron density component of ion cyclotron emission on devices having confining magnetic field of a few tesla, thus extending the purely temporal measurements provided so far by magnetic probes.},

The ability to model {ICE} signals accurately is an essential step towards inferring the characteristics of confined energetic alpha particles or fast neutral beam ions and background plasma. In this paper, the linear growth rates of the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability, which is the leading explanation for {ICE}, are calculated in high-resolution 2D space for parameters corresponding to {JET} Pulse No. 26148. These calculations further highlight the origin of doublet splitting of the cyclotron harmonics and the perceived need to invoke nonlinear interactions with 1D3V particle-in-cell studies to account for lower harmonics with substantial amplitudes. The inclusion of signals of {ICE} from a well-resolved range of propagation angles can also account for these effects.},

Phys.) experiments on high-temperature plasmas, that culminated in the study of deuterium–tritium D–T plasmas containing significant populations of energetic alpha particles, spanned over two decades from conception to completion. During the design of TFTR, the key physics issues were magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and stability, plasma energy transport, impurity effects, and plasma reactivity. Energetic particle physics was given less attention during this phase because, in part, of the necessity to address the issues that would create the conditions for the study of energetic particles and also the lack of diagnostics to study the energetic particles in detail. The worldwide tokamak program including the contributions from TFTR made substantial progress during the past two decades in addressing the fundamental issues affecting the performance of high-temperature plasmas and the behavior of energetic particles. The progress has been the result of the construction of new facilities, which enabled the production of high-temperature well-confined plasmas, development of sophisticated diagnostic techniques to study both the background plasma and the resulting energetic fusion products, and computational techniques to both interpret the experimental results and to predict the outcome of experiments.},

A single-null X-point magnetic configuration, diverted onto the upper carbon target, with reversed toroidal magnetic field was chosen. Deuterium plasmas were heated by high power, long duration deuterium neutral beams from fourteen sources and fuelled also by up to two neutral beam sources injecting tritium. The results from three of these high performance hot ion H-mode discharges are described: a high performance pure deuterium discharge; a deuterium-tritium discharge with a 1\% mixture of tritium fed to one neutral beam source; and a deuterium-tritium discharge with 100\% tritium fed to two neutral beam sources. The TRANSP code was used to check the internal consistency of the measured data and to determine the origin of the measured neutron fluxes. In the best deuterium-tritium discharge, the tritium concentration was about 11\% at the time of peak performance, when the total neutron emission rate was 6.0 × 1017 neutrons/s. The integrated total neutron yield over the high power phase, which lasted about 2 s, was 7.2 × 1017 neutrons, with an accuracy of ±7\%. The actual fusion amplification factor, QDT was about 0.15},

	abstract = {Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) was the first collective radiative instability, driven by confined fusion-born ions, observed from deuterium-tritium plasmas in JET and TFTR. ICE comprises strongly suprathermal emission, which has spectral peaks at multiple ion cyclotron harmonic frequencies as evaluated at the outer mid-plane edge of tokamak plasmas. The measured intensity of ICE spectral peaks scaled linearly with measured fusion reactivity in JET. In other large tokamak plasmas, ICE is currently used as an indicator of fast ions physics. The excitation mechanism for ICE is the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI); in the case of JET and TFTR, the MCI is driven by a set of centrally born trapped fusion products, lying just inside the trapped-passing boundary in velocity space, whose drift orbits make large radial excursions to the outer mid-plane edge. Diagnostic exploitation of ICE in future experiments therefore rests in part on deep understanding of the MCI, and recent advances in computational plasma physics have led to substantial recent progress, reviewed here. Particle-in-cell simulations of the MCI, with fully kinetic ions and electrons, were reported in 2013, using plasma parameters for JET ICE observations. The hybrid approximation for plasma simulations, where ions are treated as particles and electrons as a neutralising massless fluid, was then applied and reported in 2014. These simulations extend previous studies deep into the nonlinear regime of the MCI, and corroborate predictions by linear analytical theory, thereby strengthening further the link to ICE measurements. ICE is a potential diagnostic for confined alpha-particles in ITER, where measurements of ICE could yield information on energetic ion behaviour supplementing that obtainable from other diagnostics. In addition, it may be possible to use ICE to study fast ion redistribution and loss due to MHD activity in ITER.},

Three types of neutron flux monitor assemblies with different sensitivities and shielding materials have been designed. Through MCNP (Mante-Carlo neutral particle transport code) calculations, this extended system of NFM can detect the neutron flux in a range of 104 n/(cm2·s) to 1014 n/(cm2·s). It is capable of providing accurate neutron yield measurements for all operational modes encountered in the ITER experiments including the in-situ calibration. Combining both the counting mode and Campbelling (MSV; Mean Square Voltage) mode in the signal processing units, the requirement of the dynamic range (107) for these NFMs and time resolution (1 ms) can be met. Based on a uncertainty analysis, the estimated absolute measurement accuracies of the total fusion neutron yield can reach the required 10\% level in both the early stage of the DD-phase and the full power DT operation mode.

Fast ion populations created by fusion reactions, by neutral beam injection and by radiofrequency (RF) heating are usually concentrated in the centre of the plasma. The velocity distribution of these fast ion populations is determined primarily by Coulomb scattering; during wave heating, perpendicular acceleration by the RF waves is also important. Transport of fast ions is typically much slower than thermal transport, except during MHD events. Intense fast ion populations drive collective instabilities.

The emissions at the crash events of edge-localized modes ({ELMs}) are found to occur as strong {RF} bursts with dynamic features in intensity and spectrum. The {RF} burst spectra (obtained with frequency resolution better than 10 {MHz}) exhibit diverse spectral features and evolve in multiple steps before the onset and through the {ELM} crash: (1) a narrow-band spectral line around 200 {MHz} persistent for extended duration in the pre-{ELM} crash times, (2) harmonic spectral lines with spacing comparable to deuterium or hydrogen ion cyclotron frequency at the pedestal, (3) rapid onset (faster than 1 μs) of intense {RF} burst with wide-band continuum in frequency which coincides with the onset of {ELM} crash, and (4) a few additional intense {RF} bursts with chirping-down narrow-band spectrum during the crash. These observations indicate plasma waves are excited in the pedestal region and strongly correlated with the {ELM} dynamics such as the onset of the explosive crash. Thus the investigation of {RF} burst occurrence and their dynamic spectral features potentially offers the possibility of exploring H-mode physics in great detail.},

	abstract = {Observations have recently been made of ion cyclotron emission ({ICE}) that originates from the core plasma in the {DIII}-D and {ASDEX}-Upgrade tokamaks. In some of these cases, the {ICE} spectral peaks correspond to the local cyclotron harmonic frequencies of fusion-born ions close to the magnetic axis. This is in contrast to the hitherto usual spatial localisation of the {ICE} source to the outer midplane edge in tokamak and stellarator plasmas. Here we show that a possible emission mechanism for core {ICE} in {ASDEX}-Upgrade deuterium plasmas can arise from the rapid onset and rise of local fusion reactivity. This would give rise to a transiently highly non-Maxwellian population of fusion-born protons near their birth energy, prior to collisional slowing-down on longer timescales. Such populations are often liable to fast radiative relaxation under the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability which underpins {ICE}, depending also on bulk plasma parameter values. We, therefore, perform first principles computations of the self-consistent collective relaxation of such a population, using a particle-in-cell code, for plasma parameters appropriate to the {ASDEX}-Upgrade core. The resulting simulated {ICE} spectra include a strong peak at the proton cyclotron frequency that corresponds well to the observations.},

	abstract = {Intense bursts of suprathermal radiation, with spectral peaks at frequencies corresponding to the deuteron cyclotron frequency in the outer midplane edge region, are often detected from deuterium plasmas in the KSTAR tokamak that are heated by tangential neutral beam injection (NBI) of deuterons at 100 keV. Identifying the physical process by which this deuterium ion cyclotron emission (ICE) is generated, typically during the crash of edge localised modes, assists the understanding of collective energetic ion behaviour in tokamak plasmas. In the context of KSTAR deuterium plasmas, it is also important to distinguish deuterium ICE from the ICE at cyclotron harmonics of fusion-born protons examined by Chapman et al (2017 Nuclear Fusion 57 124004; 2018 Nuclear Fusion 58 096027). We use particle orbit studies in KSTAR-relevant magnetic field geometry, combined with a linear analytical treatment of the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI), to identify the sub-population of freshly ionised NBI deuterons that is likely to excite deuterium ICE. These deuterons are then represented as an energetic minority, together with the majority thermal deuteron population and electrons, in first principles kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) computational studies. By solving the Maxwell–Lorentz equations directly for hundreds of millions of interacting particles with resolved gyro-orbits, together with the self-consistent electric and magnetic fields, the PIC approach enables us to study the collective relaxation of the energetic deuterons through the linear phase and deep into the saturated regime. The Fourier transform of the excited fields displays strong spectral peaks at multiple successive deuteron cyclotron harmonics, mapping well to the observed KSTAR deuterium ICE spectra. This outcome, combined with the time-evolution of the energy densities of the different particle populations and electric and magnetic field components seen in the PIC computations, supports our identification of the driving sub-population of NBI deuterons, and the hypothesis that its relaxation through the MCI generates the observed deuterium ICE signal. We conclude that the physical origin of this signal in KSTAR is indeed distinct from that of KSTAR proton ICE, and is in the same category as the NBI-driven ICE seen notably in the TFTR tokamak and LHD heliotron–stellarator plasmas. ICE has been proposed as a potential passive diagnostic of energetic particle populations in ITER plasmas; this is assisted by clarifying and extending the physics basis of ICE in contemporary magnetically confined plasmas.},

	abstract = {Collective ion cyclotron emission (ICE) at the ion cyclotron frequency and its harmonics is a potential passive diagnostic of the fast-ion distribution in fusion reactors. ICE is observed in most plasmas in the DIII-D tokamak and is most strongly excited by the fast ions from neutral beam injection. The conventional outboard-edge ICE is detected in H-mode plasmas. However, weaker centrally-localized ICE is measured in L-mode plasmas, including those with negative triangularity shapes. Similar ICE spectra are found with both ICE diagnostics systems, the dedicated magnetic probes and the instrumented antenna straps. Many differences in the behavior of this central ICE are generated by varying the deuterium beam injection angle into deuterium plasmas. The co-current ‘near-perpendicular’ beam excites the most central ICE from the co-current beams, with this emission detected from the fundamental to the fifth ICE harmonic. However, the counter-current ‘near-tangential’ beam destabilizes the highest amounts of centrally-localized ICE. This emission is spectrally broader than that driven by the co-current beams and is observed up to its seventh ICE harmonic. The central ICE excited by this co-current beam correlated strongly on the local electron density and related parameters (plasma current and neutron rate) and increased with deeper fast-ion loss boundaries towards the magnetic axis. This was also the case with second harmonic ICE driven by the counter-current beam but not with its stronger third harmonic emission. The central ICE harmonics destabilized by both beams are observed to have different temporal dynamics. The central ICE amplitude responds rapidly to transient MHD events; it dropped and recovered in less than a millisecond at each sawtooth event. ICE frequency splitting is triggered by both the co-current and counter-current ‘near-tangential’ beams. The data presented in this paper provide opportunities to test and validate models of excitation of ICE by energetic ions.},

The observed core ICE amplitude evolution in beam-heated plasmas is consistent with the MCI and is a result of competition between the beam ion fraction build-up (which increases the instability growth rate) and the slowing down of the dominant beam ion velocity component (which stabilizes the MCI). The oblique propagation angle is constrained to lie in the range 75–78°, where the lower bound is governed by the fast wave reabsorption losses on plasma electrons and bulk ions and the upper bound is governed by the experimentally observed ICE amplitude growth time. Although the oblique MCI is a local theory and does not provide information on the radial mode localization, the calculated instability growth rates are broadly consistent with the observed dynamics of the core ICE amplitude on the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.},

Experiments were performed in deuterium or hydrogen target plasmas, with the neutral heating beam consisting of 60\% deuterium and 40\% hydrogen atoms accelerated up to 16 keV. High-frequency internal magnetic probes were used as a diagnostic tool for ICE detection. In deuterium plasmas, emission with 13 MHz frequency was observed, with 1–2 ms delay after the NBI pulse front; this frequency corresponds approximately to fundamental ion cyclotron (IC) resonance for hydrogen near the magnetic axis. In hydrogen plasmas, ICE with frequency 7 MHz was observed. In both cases, the observed frequency scales as IC resonance of minority ions. In deuterium plasmas, the hydrogen minority ICE spectral line was found to consist of several narrow (width 50 kHz) spectral components, typically three or more, with different spacing (of the order of 50–200 kHz), and temporal dynamics in synchronicity with sawtooth oscillations. The ICE with the frequency corresponding to IC resonance for majority ions was also observed in several hydrogen and deuterium discharges. Theoretical models developed for the explanation of NBI ICE on other tokamaks are not easily applicable for the phenomena observed on the TUMAN-3M. In pure ohmically heated deuterium and hydrogen plasmas, i.e. in the absence of fast ions, a weak ICE was also observed, with frequency scaling as IC resonance condition in close proximity to the probe location.},

As the initial RF emission becomes saturated, there is another onset of intense RF bursts occurring at discrete frequencies, broadening the emission frequency range further, either at higher or lower frequencies. In some cases, the time interval of the intense RF bursts at the dominant frequency is comparable with the toroidal rotation period at the radial location where fLH ∼ dominant frequency. The rapid rise and saturation of RF emission intensity in a broad frequency range indicate that a small population of fast ions is sufficient for the growth of energetic particle driven instabilities on the LFS. The multiple onsets in RF emission and the intense RF burst repetition frequency comparable with toroidal rotation frequency indicate the possibility that reorganization in the anisotropic fast ion population results in localized growth of the above instabilities. A gradual decay of RF emission intensity over few tens of milliseconds indicate that enhanced population of fast ions has damping effect on these instabilities.},

	abstract = {Measurements are reported of electromagnetic emission close to the cyclotron frequency of energetic ions in JET plasmas heated by waves in the ion cylotron range of frequencies (ICRF). Hydrogen was the majority ion species in all of these plasmas. The measurements were obtained using a sub-harmonic arc detection system in the transmission lines of one of the ICRF antennas. The measured ion cyclotron emission spectra were strongly filtered by the antenna system, and typically contained sub-structure, consisting of sets of peaks with a separation of a few kHz, suggesting the excitation of compressional Alfvén eigenmodes closely spaced in frequency. In most cases the energetic ions can be clearly identified as ICRF wave-accelerated 3He minority ions, although in two pulses the emission may have been produced by energetic 4He ions, originating from third harmonic ICRF wave acceleration. It is proposed that the emission close to the 3He cyclotron frequency was produced by energetic ions of this species undergoing drift orbit excursions to the outer midplane plasma edge. Particle-in-cell and hybrid (kinetic ion, fluid electron) simulations using plasma parameters corresponding to edge plasma conditions in these JET pulses, and energetic particle parameters inferred from the cyclotron resonance location, indicate strong excitation of waves at multiple 3He cyclotron harmonics, including the fundamental, which is identified with the observed emission. These results underline the potential importance of ICE measurements as a method of studying confined fast particles that are strongly suprathermal but have insufficient energies or are not present in sufficient numbers to excite detectable levels of γ-ray emission or other collective instabilities.},

This type of {ICE} was further investigated with regard to the phase and intensity of signals. Another type of {ICE} was found in the {LHD}, and these {ICEs} were synchronized with bursts of toroidicity induced Alfvén eigenmodes ({TAE}) and the rise of intensity of lost ion flux. Therefore the source of these {ICEs} was thought to be the particles transferred from the core to the outer region of plasma by the {TAE} bursts. The frequency of {ICEs} induced by the {TAE} bursts increases linearly with the magnetic field strength, since the ion cyclotron frequency increases with the magnetic field strength.},

With photometry one may plot observed stars on a colour–magnitude diagram ({CMD}) and then compare with synthetic {CMDs} representing different star formation histories. This has been accomplished hitherto by parametrizing the model star formation history as a histogram, usually with the bin widths set by fixed increases in the logarithm of time. A best fit is then found with maximum likelihood methods and we consider the different means by which a likelihood can be calculated. We then apply Bayesian methods by parametrizing the star formation history as an unknown number of Gaussian bursts with unknown parameters. This parametrization automatically provides a smooth function of time. A Reversal Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method is then used to find both the most appropriate number of Gaussians, to avoid overfitting, and the posterior probability distribution of the star formation rate. We apply our method to artificial populations and to observed data. We discuss the other advantages of the method: direct comparison of different parametrizations and the ability to calculate the probability that a given star is from a given Gaussian. This allows the investigation of possible subpopulations.},

	abstract = {Observations have recently been made of ion cyclotron emission ({ICE}) that originates from the core plasma in the {DIII}-D (Thome et al 2018 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 89 10I102, Thome et al 2019 Nuclear Fusion http://iopscience.iop.org/10.1088/1741-4326/ab20e7) and {ASDEX}-Upgrade (Ochoukov et al 2018 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 89 10J101, Ochoukov et al 2019 Nuclear Fusion 59 014001) tokamaks. The {ICE} spectral peaks correspond to the local cyclotron harmonic frequencies of fusion-born ions close to the magnetic axis, in contrast to the hitherto usual spatial localisation of the {ICE} source to the outer midplane edge in tokamak and stellarator plasmas. Core {ICE} is temporally transient, and may sometimes be caused by the rapid onset and increase of local fusion reactivity. This would give rise to a highly non-Maxwellian population of fusion-born ions near their birth energy. In an idealised deuterium-tritium plasma, this distribution would initially be a thin spherical shell in velocity-space. For as long as it persists, as pointed out in (D’Inca 2014 Ion Cyclotron Emission on {ASDEX} Upgrade {PhD} Thesis Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat), the shell might drive the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability ({MCI}), which is the excitation process which underlies {ICE}. Here we present, under core plasma conditions, direct numerical simulations of {ICE} generation by a spherical shell distribution of fusion-born ions in velocity-space. These energetic minority ions are found to relax collectively in particle-in-cell ({PIC}) computations which follow their self-consistent gyro-orbit-resolved dynamics, together with that of the majority thermal ions and electrons, under the Maxwell–Lorentz system of equations. We relate the computational outputs, which extend into the nonlinearly saturated regime of the {MCI}, to the analytical theory of the linear {MCI} for shell-type energetic ion distributions, and to fully nonlinear simulations of related ring-beam energetic ion distributions relaxing under the {MCI}. We find that the {MCI} is excited in all cases, and that the linear growth phase of the shell simulations typically takes almost twice as long to reach saturation than in the ring-beam simulations. It is shown that for both types of velocity distribution, nonlinear wave-wave interactions play a vital role in the excitation of the {ICE} spectral peaks at lower cyclotron harmonics which are typically detected in experiments. We conclude that in future simulations for {ICE} interpretation, ring-beam distributions may provide an acceptable proxy for shell distributions, while using significantly fewer computational particles and still maintaining a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio.},

	abstract = {Ion cyclotron emission ({ICE}) has been observed during D-T discharges in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor ({TFTR}), using {RF} probes located near the top and the bottom of the vacuum vessel. Harmonics of the alpha cyclotron frequency ( Omega a,) evaluated at the outer midplane plasma edge are observed at the onset of the beam injection phase of {TFTR} supershots and persist for approximately 100-250 ms. These results are in contrast with observations of {ICE} in {JET}, in which harmonics of Omega a evolve with the alpha population in the plasma edge. Such differences are believed to be due to the fact that newly born fusion alpha particles are super-Alfvenic near the edge of {JET} plasmas, while they are sub-Alfvenic near the edge of {TFTR} supershot plasmas. In {TFTR} discharges with edge densities such that newly born alpha particles are super-Alfvenic, alpha cyclotron harmonics are observed to persist. These results are in qualitative agreement with numerical calculations of growth rates due to the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability},

For a search window of size M and a template of size N the fast {NCC} requires only approximately 2N⋅(M−N+1) additions/subtractions without multiplications. Simulation results with 100,000 test signals show that the use of the fast {NCC} instead of the traditional approaches for the determination of the degree of similarity between a test signal and a reference signal (template) brings about a significant improvement in terms of false negative rate, identification rate and computational cost without a significant increase in false positive rate, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) is higher than 3 {dB}.},

The mode resonates with the precession motion of helically trapped energetic ions (EPs), following the resonant condition. The radial mode structure is recognized to be similar to that of the pressure-driven resistive interchange mode, of which radial displacement eigenfunction quite localizes around the mode rational surface, and evolves into an odd-type (or island-type) during the late of frequency chirping phase. This beam driven mode is excited when the beta value of helically trapped EPs exceeds a certain threshold. This instability is thought to be a new branch of resistive interchange mode destabilized by the trapped energetic ions. The radial transport, i.e. redistribution and losses, of helically trapped energetic ions induced by the mode transiently generates significant radial electric field near the plasma peripheral region. The large shear of thus generated radial electric field is thought to contribute to the observed suppression of micro-turbulence and transient increases of the temperature of fully ionized carbon impurity ions and electron density, suggesting improvement of bulk plasma confinement.},

	abstract = {In the Large helical device, a change of energetic particle mode is observed as He concentration is varied in ion-ITB type experiments, having constant electron density and input heating power but with a clear increase of central ion temperature in He rich discharges. This activity consists of bursty, but damped energetic interchange modes (EICs, Du et al 2015 Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 155003), whose occurrence rate is dramatically lower in the He-rich discharges. Mechanisms are discussed for the changes in drive and damping of the modes with He concentration. These EIC bursts consist of marked changes in the radial electric field, which is derived from the phase velocity of turbulence measured with the 2D phase contrast imaging (PCI) system. Similar bursts are detected in edge fast ion diagnostics. Ion thermal transport by gyro-Bohm scaling is recognised as a contribution to the change in ion temperature, though fast ion losses by these EIC modes may also contribute to the ion temperature dependence on He concentration, most particularly controlling the height of an ‘edge-pedestal’ in the profile. The steady-state level of fast ions is shown to be larger in helium rich discharges on the basis of a compact neutral particle analyser (CNPA), and the fast-ion component of the diamagnetic stored energy. These events also have an influence on turbulence and transport. The large velocity shear induced produced during these events transiently improves confinement and suppresses turbulence, and has a larger net effect when bursts are more frequent in hydrogen discharges. This exactly offsets the increased gyro-Bohm related turbulence drive in hydrogen which results in the same time-averaged turbulence level in hydrogen as in helium.},

Comparison with 2D electron cyclotron emission (ECE) images has revealed that each stage is related to the instantaneous condition at the outboard mid-plane edge. First, high-harmonic ion cyclotron emissions (ICE) are intensified with the appearance of a non-modal filamentary perturbation in the edge within several tens of microseconds before the collapse. Then, the RF emission becomes broad toward high-frequency range ({\textless}500 MHz) at the burst onset of the non-modal filament. During the pedestal collapse initiated by the filament burst, rapid chirping (1–3 μs) appear with additional filament bursts. The strong correlation between the RF spectra and the perturbation structure provides important clues on the stability of edge-localized modes and on the ion dynamics in the plasma boundary.},

The narrowband emissions exhibit rapid rising and falling tones within a few microseconds. Bispectral analyses reveal the existence of nonlinear interactions between the broadband and the narrowband waves, confirming their concurrence in the barrier zone.

	abstract = {In this paper, ion cyclotron emissions (ICEs) due to deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion-product (FP) 3He, T and P-ions on JT-60U are described. Electromagnetic waves with finite toroidal wave numbers are detected by using ion cyclotron range of frequency antennas as pickup loops. The toroidal wave numbers are evaluated from the phase differences between two antenna straps arrayed in the toroidal direction. The excitation of the fast Alfvén waves for the mechanism of ICEs due to 3He and P-ions, ICE(3He) and ICE(P), is consistent with that in the previous JET and TFTR experiments. ICE due to T-ions, ICE(T), with lower frequency has larger wave numbers than ICE(3He). The excitation of the slow Alfvén waves is elucidated for the first time as the mechanism for ICE(T). The density dependence for the excitation of the fundamental and the second harmonic ICEs(3He) is obtained. The fundamental ICE(3He) appears only in relatively low density operation. A frequency peak due to FP-ions sometimes splits into a doublet shape as observed in JET experiments. The phase differences of both peaks are detected to be positive and negative values and indicate that two waves are traveling in both toroidal directions. The anisotropy of the FP T-ions at the outer plasma edge is evaluated by using ‘Escape Particle Orbit analysis Code (EPOC)’. The precise behaviors of ICEs due to FP-ions on JT-60U are studied.},

	abstract = {High-frequency fluctuations in the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) are excited in magnetically confined plasmas because of the distortion of velocity distribution. In deuterium plasma experiments in JT-60U, ion cyclotron emission (ICE) detected as magnetic fluctuations is observed using ICRF antennas as pickup loops. The toroidal wave-numbers can be estimated using the phase differences between the signals from antenna elements arrayed in the toroidal direction. In this manuscript, ICE due to fusion product (FP) H ions, ICE(H), which is identified separately from the second-harmonic ICE caused by D ions, is newly reported. ICE is considered to result from spontaneous excitation of magnetosonic waves associated with FP high-energy ions. ICE caused by 3He ions and T ions has already been identified and confirmed to have finite toroidal wave-numbers. In contrast, ICE caused by ions originating in neutral beam injection has no toroidal wave-numbers. It is suggested that the appearance of ICE(H) depends strongly on the plasma density, and weak magnetic shear operation is one of the possible conditions for the observation of ICE(H).},

We investigate particle orbits by changing the beta value and/or the magnetic field strength. No significant difference is found in the particle orbit classifications between the vacuum magnetic field and the finite beta plasma cases. The deviation of a banana orbit from the flux surfaces strongly depends on the beta value, although the deviation of the orbit of a passing particle is independent of the beta value. In addition, the deviation of the orbit of the passing particle, rather than that of the banana-orbit particles, depends on the magnetic field strength. We also examine the effect of re-entering particles, which repeatedly pass in and out of the last closed flux surface, in the finite beta plasma of the LHD. It is found that the number of re-entering particles in the finite beta plasma is larger than that in the vacuum magnetic field. As a result, the role of reentering particles in the finite beta plasma of the LHD is more important than that in the vacuum magnetic field, and the effect of the charge-exchange reaction on particle confinement in the finite beta plasma is large.},

The Maxwellian is by far the most widespread model for ions and electrons in tokamaks and stellarators. The bi-Maxwellian and the drifting (bi-)Maxwellian are extensions allowing for anisotropy and bulk plasma flow, respectively. For example, fast ions generated by wave heating in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies are often described by bi-Maxwellians or so-called tail temperatures. The ring distribution can serve as a basic building block for arbitrary distributions or as a bump-on-tail in stability studies. The isotropic slowing-down distribution is a good model for fusion α-particles. The anisotropic slowing-down distribution occurs for anisotropic particle sources as is typical for neutral beam injection. We physically motivate these distribution functions and present analytical models in various coordinate systems commonly used by theorists and experimentalists. We further calculate 1D projections of the distribution functions onto a diagnostic line-of-sight to gain insight into measurements relying on the Doppler shift.},

The simulation shows that the ion cyclotron harmonic wave with ω ≃ lΩi, where l is an integer and Ωi is the ion cyclotron frequency, is excited when ωLH becomes close to lΩi. When ωLH is greater than lΩi, this wave couples with the ion Bernstein mode that has the dispersion curve connecting to ωLH. It is also found that as a result of the instabilities and the wave-wave coupling, the stair-like frequency chirping with the riser Ωi appears in the magnetic fluctuations in the frequency range of ωLH. The frequency chirping has characteristics similar to the frequency chirping observed in the RF radiations at the plasma start-up phase of the LHD experiments.},

The measured spectra agree very well with synthetic spectra calculated from a TRANSP/NUBEAM simulation. Based on the measured FIDA spectra alone, we infer f(v‖, v⊥) by tomographic inversion. Salient features of our measurement of f(v‖, v⊥) agree reasonably well with the simulation: the measured as well as the simulated f(v‖, v⊥) are lopsided towards negative velocities parallel to the magnetic field, and they have similar shapes. Further, the peaks in the simulation of f(v‖, v⊥) at full and half injection energies of the neutral beam also appear in the measurement at similar velocity-space locations. We expect that we can measure spectra in up to seven views simultaneously in the next ASDEX Upgrade campaign which would further improve measurements of f(v‖, v⊥) by tomographic inversion.},

	abstract = {The measurement of the energy spectra and densities of α-particles and other fast ions are part of the ITER measurement requirements, highlighting the importance of energy-resolved energetic-particle measurements for the mission of ITER. However, it has been found in recent years that the velocity-space interrogation regions of the foreseen energetic-particle diagnostics do not allow these measurements directly. We will demonstrate this for γ-ray spectroscopy (GRS), collective Thomson scattering (CTS), neutron emission spectroscopy and fast-ion Dα spectroscopy by invoking energy and momentum conservation in each case, highlighting analogies and differences between the different diagnostic velocity-space sensitivities. Nevertheless, energy spectra and densities can be inferred by velocity-space tomography which we demonstrate using measurements at JET and ASDEX Upgrade. The measured energy spectra agree well with corresponding simulations. At ITER, α-particle energy spectra and densities can be inferred for energies larger than 1.7 MeV by velocity-space tomography based on GRS and CTS. Further, assuming isotropy of the α-particles in velocity space, their energy spectra and densities can be inferred by 1D inversion of spectral single-detector measurements down to about 300 keV by CTS. The α-particle density can also be found by fitting a model to the CTS measurements assuming the α-particle distribution to be an isotropic slowing-down distribution.},

Thus, the optimal mapping gs;θ of the neural network in terms of the number of nodes, the number of layers, and the values of the hyperparameters, where θ is the learned model parameters, is determined by comparing many different configurations of the network on the same training and test set and choosing the best one based on its average test error. The training and test sets are generated by computing random ICE velocity distribution functions f and their corresponding ICE signals s by modeling the relationship as the linear matrix equation Wf = s. The simulated ICE signals are modeled as edge ICE signals at LHD. The network predictions for f based on ICE signals s are on many simulated ICE signal examples closer to the true velocity distribution function than that obtained by 0th-order Tikhonov regularization, although there might be qualitative differences in which features one technique is better at predicting than the other. Additionally, the network computations are much faster. Adapted versions of the network can be applied to future experimental ICE data to infer fast-ion velocity distribution functions.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous shear flow generation in magnetized fusion plasmas is thought to occur by an interaction of the turbulent Reynolds stress with the shear flow. This interaction can be viewed as a transfer of turbulent energy to the shear flow scales via a three-wave coupling process, which suggests that investigations of bispectral quantities may be of interest. In this paper, we discuss the theory of mean flow generation when described via the bispectrum. Simple theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate the connection between the bispectrum and the nonlinear amplification mechanism for zonal shear flows. We also discuss results from analysis of edge fluctuations from DIII-D during an L-H transition. These results indicate a transient rise and fall of three-wave coupling during the transition, which is spatially localized to inside the separatrix. Future efforts to determine the direction and rate of turbulent energy transfer during shear-flow formation will also be discussed.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional solutions of compressional Alfven eigenmodes ({CAEs}) are studied in the cold plasma approximation. For finite inverse aspect ratio tokamak plasmas the two-dimensional eigenmode envelope is localized at the low magnetic field side with the radial and poloidal localization on the order of a/ square root m and a/4 square root m, respectively, where m is the dominant poloidal mode number. Charged fusion product driven Alfven cyclotron instability ({ACI}) of the compressional Alfven eigenmodes provides the explanation for the ion cyclotron emission ({ICE}) spectrum observed in tokamak experiments. The {ACI} is excited by fast charged fusion products via Doppler shifted cyclotron wave-particle resonances. The ion cyclotron and electron Landau dampings and fast particle instability drive are calculated perturbatively for deuterium-deuterium ({DD}) and deuterium-tritium ({DT}) plasmas. Near the plasma edge at the low field side the velocity distribution function of charged fusion products is localized in both pitch angle and velocity. The poloidal localization of the eigenmode enhances the {ACI} growth rates by a factor of square root m in comparison with the previous results without poloidal envelope. The thermal ion cyclotron damping determines that only modes with eigenfrequencies at multiples of the edge cyclotron frequency of the background ions can be easily excited and form an {ICE} spectrum similar to the experimental observations. Theoretical understanding is given for the results of {TFTR} {DD} and {DT} experiments with valpha 0/{vA} approximately=1 and {JET} experiments with valpha 0/{vA}{\textgreater}1},
